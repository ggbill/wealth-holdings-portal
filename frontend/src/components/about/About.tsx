                    Mr G is short for Mr Gidaropoulos (not gangsta) and I am a maths teacher at The Totteridge Academy. I built this website to help you understand mathematics through my video solutions to past paper questions. These are accompanied by some maths chants we use at The Totteridge Academy, which are crucial in highlighting the key knowledge you need in a way that is easy to memorise. There are also some key skills videos that target specific grades for all types of maths dons.
